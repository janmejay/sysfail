Sysfail is a shared library that helps test applications with failure-injection.

## Overview

Automated testing is key to building high quality software. Most modern
software depends on external services or processes such as databases, queues,
caches etc in addition to other stateful components like filesystems and
devices.
System-calls are the common interface that userland applications use to talk to
other processes / services and to the operating-system itself which makes them
a powerful abstraction for testing applications' failure-resilience and
robustness.
Sysfail helps declaratively expose application (system under test) to failures
and delays and helps harden non-functional properties such as idempotency,
checkpoint-recovery, retries / ability to make progress in the face of
degradation / errors etc.

## Features

* Inject failures and / or delay to any system-call of choice
* Specify mix-of / weights-for errors that are presented in response to failure
* Fine grained control on threads that are failure-injected
* Specify fraction of errors that are injected before and / or after the syscall
* Modern C++23 interface
* C API that also serves as foreign-function-interface (FFI) for other languages (eg. Golang)
* Ability to failure-inject regardless of extent of control on the actual call-site (eg. 3rd-party libraries)

## Limitations

* At the moment Sysfail only supports Linux + x86_64 / amd64 platform. [^1]
* While ABI for use over FFI-bridge exists, it does not yet have idomatic
  wrappers for other languages. [^1]
* It makes use of [syscall-user-dispatch (aka SUD)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/admin-guide/syscall-user-dispatch.rst),
  so requires Linux version 5.11 or higher.
* `libc` sometimes quiesces all signal-handlers (which SUD uses) for brief
  periods (eg. while creating new threads). Sysfail disables failure injection
  in such cases to avoid breaking `libc`'s assumptions
* Some syscalls such as `SYS_rt_sigprocmask` are never failure-injected because
  this would break `libc` code-paths such as the one described above.

[^1]: Patches are most welcome!

## Install

Sysfail needs g++, libtbb-dev and libgtest-dev.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rubrikinc/sysfail
$ cd sysfail
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```

OR

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rubrikinc/sysfail
$ docker build -t sysfail:test .
```
which creates a local ubuntu image with sysfail installed. Feel free to modify
Dockerfile to your liking (eg. preferred base-image, install location etc).

Once built, `run` to play with sysfail in the container
```
$ docker run -it sysfail:test /bin/bash
# make
...
```
or build and test with it, like so
```
...
# su - ubuntu
$ g++ -o flaky_print flaky_print.cc -lsysfail
```
(`flaky_print.cc` should already be present)


## Using sysfail

The headers `sysfail.hh` and `sysfail.h` contain fully documented API for C++
and C respectively. Linker flag `-lsysfail` links with the library.

Test files `session_test.cc` and `cwrapper_test.cc` serve as working examples of
usage in C++ and C. `ffi.go` uses FFI (foreign-function-interface) in a
standalone-process form-factor, so can serve as a working example for non C / C++
projects.
